# Personal Finance Manager — Design Patterns Project

This project is a hands-on exercise in applying Object-Oriented Design Patterns to build a simplified personal finance manager.
You will implement and extend starter code to add functionality such as tracking transactions, adapting external data, observing balance changes, and ensuring proper architectural patterns.

## Getting Started

Instructions for how to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have python version >= 3.10.x installed on your computer. 


### Installation

Step by step explanation of how to get a dev environment running.

List out the steps

1. Clone the repo

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/cd14600-project-starter.git
cd cd14600-project-starter/starter
```

2. Run the Program: 
```
python main.py
```

## Testing

This project uses Python’s built-in unittest framework.

To run all tests:

```
python -m unittest discover
```

To run a single test file:
```
python -m unittest balance/test_balance_observer.py
```

### Break Down Tests

- test_balance.py → Verifies correct implementation of the Singleton Balance class.
- test_transaction.py → Confirms transactions update balances correctly.
- test_transaction_adapter.py → Ensures external income data is correctly adapted into Transaction objects.
- test_balance_observer.py → Validates that low-balance alerts are triggered at the correct threshold.
- test_student_pattern.py → (Optional) Tests the additional design pattern chosen by the learner.

## Project Instructions

1. Implement Singleton Balance Class – Ensure only one balance object exists throughout the app.
2. Complete Transaction Class – Handle income and expense transactions.
3. Implement Adapter Pattern – Adapt external freelance income data into internal Transaction objects.
4. Implement Observer Pattern – Create a low balance observer that triggers an alert when funds drop too low.
5. Add Unit Tests – Write tests for all implemented functionality.
6. Choose and Implement a Fourth Pattern – Pick one additional design pattern (e.g., Strategy, Command, Decorator, etc.) and integrate it into your project.
7. Provide a Reflection – Add a short write-up in your repo (README or separate file) explaining your design choices.
